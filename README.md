# Quiz Management System

This is a simple Python-based quiz system where users can take quizzes, view their scores, and check leaderboards. Admins can manage quiz categories and questions through an easy-to-use interface. The app uses MySQL to store user info, quiz data, and results.

## Features

- **User Accounts:** Users can log in or create new accounts.
- **Quiz Categories:** Admins can add, update, or remove categories.
- **Dynamic Quizzes:** Each quiz randomly picks 15 questions from the selected category.
- **Score Tracking:** Users can see their scores after each quiz and view their overall performance.
- **Leaderboard:** Shows top-performing users based on cumulative scores.
- **Admin Tools:** Admins can manage questions and categories easily.

## How It Works

1. **For Users:**
   - Log in with your username and password.
   - Pick a quiz category and answer 15 random questions.
   - Check your score and view your quiz history or leaderboard ranking.

2. **For Admins:**
   - Log in as admin (default credentials provided).
   - Add, update, or delete quiz categories and questions.
